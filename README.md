## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code version 1.74.0 or higher (if you are using vscode fork, check it under Help > About)
- [openclaw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openclaw) installed; if not, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

- [gguf-connector](https://pypi.org/project/gguf-connector/) installed; if not, install it via pip/pip3:

```bash
pip install gguf-connector
```

*if you don't use the Terminal button then gguf-connector is optional

## Features

- **Menu Selection Scheme**: Re-structured to provide command menu with options:
  - Dashboard
  - Checker (checks openclaw package status; this will help and walk you through: install/upgrade it to the latest version)
  - Setup
    - Onboard
    - Pair up
      - no headache and simplify the pairing process
    - Doctor
    - Console
  - Gateway
    - Run
    - Status
    - Start
    - Stop
    - Restart
  - Terminal (gguf-connector needed)

- **OS Detection**: Automatically detects operating system:
  - Uses WSL terminal on Windows (please study [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first if you don't have it as openclaw doesn't work well in powershell and git bash recently; you might need to add Path to Environment Variables... i.e., `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<UserName>\.npm-global\bin`)
  - Uses native terminal on other platforms

- **Auto-Connect**: Optional setting to automatically connect on startup (disabled by default)

- **Terminal Management**: Creates or reuses terminal based on OS detection
- **Command Execution**: Supports multiple commands (dashboard, gateway, etc.)
